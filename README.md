# FastClass v5

## Project Overview

FastClass, in its current stage, is an extensive Python data scraper that scrapes both the mySDSU class registration pages and all the professor ratings from RateMyProfessors.

<br />

**I can then use this data to determine things like:**

* Who the best Computer Science professors are to determine which electives to take
* How I can create my schedule to have no 9AM classes and no Friday classes
* Which General Education classes I can take that are fully remote and asynchonous

## How This Came To Be

In my Freshman year at college, I wanted to see if it was possible to take the easiest general education classes at my school and have absolutely no classes on Thursdays or Fridays (typical college student). There was just one problem -- I didn't know how to code and I was currently a marketing major at SDSU. I'd always loved technology and went to those summer camps when I was a kid where you made games in GameMaker Studio or RPGMaker, but I'd never really stuck with programming as I chased other endeavors. However, I now had finally found that problem I was incredibly interested in solving. I immediately went out and bought "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" and ripped through the book in less than three weeks. This is when I realized I absolutely loved programming and solving problems. I switched my major to Computer Science, and two years later: here we are. I have most likely rewritten this project more than five times at this point, but let's just call it v5 because it looks clean! The goal is to make FastClass into the original vision I had as a Freshman -- a "one stop shop" for students to find the classes and schedule that works for them in as easy as a few clicks.
